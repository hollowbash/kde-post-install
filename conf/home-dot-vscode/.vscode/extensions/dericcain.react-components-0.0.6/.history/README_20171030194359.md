# React Components
React Components saves you time be scaffolding out your React Components. When you create a React component, you can also have a test created with it, with a Jest snapshot test already created ðŸ˜ƒ 

## Installation


## Features

## Configuration

{
	"react-components.root": "<root>/src/components", // use <root> and <component>. <root> is project root and <component> is the component's path
	"react-components.fileExtension": ".js", // .js, .jsx
	"react-components.openAfterCreate": true, // true, false
	"react-components.tests": true, // true, false Create a test with your component
	"react-components.testsRoot": "<component>/__tests__", // use <root> or <component> to give a path for the test location
	"react-components.testsNameAppend": ".test", // append this to the end of the file so it can be Component.test.js or component_test.js
	"react-components.testsOpenAfterCreate": false, // true, false
}
```

## Issues

## Contributing
I know this package can be better and I have plans for it to be. If you want to chip in, here are a few things that I would like to accomplish. By all means, this is not an exhaustive list and I would love your input of ways you think it could be better.

- [ ] Add ability to use test templates. See #1
- [ ] Add the ability to create tests only (should be very easy). See #2
- [ ] Add ability to take lowercase file names and automatically create create CamelCase or snake_case file names from them. This may be tricky. See #3
- [ ] Add ability to have lifecycle methods in the created component. See #4
- [ ] Extract some code from a file into its own component. See #5
- [ ] Add test. See #6

If you you want to help, please feel free create an issue and talk about what you want to change/fix/add. Once we have discused the changes that need to be made, fork the repo, make the changes and submit a pull request. Make sure that your code is linted before submitting the pull request.
