## Installation


## Features

## Configuration
```JSON
{
	"react-components.root": "<root>/src/components", // use <root> and <component>. <root> is project root and <component> is the component's path
	"react-components.fileExtension": ".js", // .js, .jsx
	"react-components.openAfterCreate": true, // true, false
	"react-components.tests": true, // true, false Create a test with your component
	"react-components.testsRoot": "<component>/__tests__", // use <root> or <component> to give a path for the test location
	"react-components.testsNameAppend": ".test", // append this to the end of the file so it can be Component.test.js or component_test.js
	"react-components.testsOpenAfterCreate": false, // true, false
}
```
